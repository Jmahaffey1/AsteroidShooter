Hello, my name is Jacob Mahaffey and I am Junior at Illinois Wesleyan University.

I am currently doing this project in hopes to learn the arcade library and create a simple game I can give to friends and family.

I have taken much of the beginning code from arcade's official documentation that can be found here: 
https://arcade.academy/examples/sprite_collect_coins.html

I hope to branch off of this code to create something else.
